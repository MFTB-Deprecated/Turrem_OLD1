Turrem
======

Turrem is an upcoming Real Time Strategy game focused on building your nation from the beginnings of civilization all the way up to the modern era. Its dynamic world, creative focus, and unique mechanics promise an enjoyably deep experience. As we are still in the early stages of development, the game is currently open-source on GitHub, but an eventual release through Steam Greenlight would be our end goal.
